This is the repository for all my projects associated with university (labs, practical tasks, course works etc.).
* I am majoring in Software Engineering.

The structure and detailed explanation:
    > sem1 - folder for all my projects from 1 semester
        > kdm - Computer Discrete Mathematics ("Kompyuterna dyskretna matematyka") - implementations of different problems, structures etc.
from the field which include: logical operations, sets, graphs (oriented and unoriented), trees, finitary relations.
        > op - Basics of Programming ("Osnovy prohramuvannya") - different project/tasks that correspond each topic from my C language course.
    > sem2 - folder for all my projects from 2 semester
        > chm - Numerical Analysis ("Chyselni metody") - implementations of different tasks that solve the problems of the field: precise and
approximate solving of linear and nonlinear equations, systems of equations, approximating discrete equation, approximation of a function,
integration and cauchy problems.
        > oop - Object-Oriented Programming ("Obyektno-Oriyentovane Prohramuvannya") - it is the continuation of op course, where I dived deeper
in object-oriented pattern of programming using C++.
        > tests - just a draft
        > vipz - Basics of Software Engineering ("Vstup do inzheneriyi prohramnoho zabezpechennya") - one folder - "lab0" is just a preperation
for further study of the subject. It is just a refactored project of the last lab from op (sem1)
    > sem3 - folder for all my projects from 1 semester
        > akkm - Computer Architecture and Computer Networks ("Arhitektura kompyutera ta kompyuternykh merezh") - here I studied computer
architecture (lab 1-7), built different schemes in proteus, wrote an Assembly code for Intel and Arm processors (using Visual Studio/VS Code and Keil
respectively). Also here is a single lab (lab 14) from Computer Networks course where there is just a text file which was later used with FTP protocol. 
        > asd - Algorithms and Data Structures ("Alhorytmy i structury danykh") - here i implemented different sorting and search algorithms and some
data structures (queues, lists etc.
        > oop - Object-Oriented Programming (part 2) ("Obyektno-Oriyentovane Prohramuvannya") - it is my couse work. An app written on C++ using Qt.
        > os - Operating Systems ("Operatsiyni systemy") - my OS couse. It consists of different topics (processes, threads, working with files and
libraries) tasks that are implemented on both Windows and Linux.
        > pkr - Teamwork practicum ("Praktykum komandnoyi roboty") - just a single practical task where my team learned git.
